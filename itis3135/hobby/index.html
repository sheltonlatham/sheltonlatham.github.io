            <h2>What: </h2>
            <p>
            At some point in your life you've played a type of video game. 
            It's an activity millions of people around the world enjoy. 
            While some developers make fun interesting levels to trick the player or challenge them.
            Others make games to tell a story. 
            A story that can invoke deep emotions and tackle deep questions. 
            I love playing a game which sometimes it takes multiple play-throughs to get everything the developer is trying to portray.
            Here you'll learn about some of the most groundbreaking storytelling video games and the themes of them as long with the beautiful visual aspect they bring.
            I know it doesn't sound like a hobby but I honestly love playing games that tell a deeper story than just good gameplay.

            <h2>About: </h2>
            <p>
                I want to start with almost a love letter to the game I've played more times than I can count. 
                Cyberpunk 2077 is a video game developed by CD Projekt Red. 
                An immersive world where mega-corporations control everything and wars between companies have put the United States into a wasteland besides from a few states.
                You play as "V" who has been away from Night City but returns after things didn't work out in Florida.
                After a mission goes wrong V now has to find a way to save his life while getting a better understanding of Night City and the people who call it home.
                Playing this game is like being transported into a completely different world. You move around the world as if you're living in the city.
                The characters feel real and have their own motivations for their actions and their goals.
                From the city to the outback area of the game, each section has its own culture that you can further explore in missions or just walk around listening to NPCs talk.
                I think the reason I love the game is the theme it tells without directly saying it.
                What it means to be human even in a world where people are suited with robotic implants and lose touch with their humanity.
                How individualism and materialism can stray people away from making deep relations with the people they meet.
                The decisions you make have drastic consequences for others whether you decide to help them or not.

                What all these games have in common is that they let the visual aspect enchance the story and immersion of their games.
                But even with a game like Ori that isn't an open world setting, its visual enchances the story it tells and complements the levels the player goes through to get a better understanding of the world.

                Now how do developers create these beautiful settings where I player can immerse themselves in the world and feel as if they're the ones walking around?

            <h2>Why: </h2>
            <p>
                Video games are beautiful to me. While at first when I was young it was a place I could escape to and enojy exploring these fantasy worlds that every little boy dreamed of being in. 
                Now they've become a place where I can explore different emotions. If I'm feeling competitive and want to test my skills I can play Call of Duty or Rainbow Six Seige, currently right now its FC 25. 
                But If I want to sit down and enjoy an amazing story will underlying themes: Elden Ring, Cyberpunk 2077, Red Dead Redemption 2, God of War (2018), Firewatch, and many more. 
                Or I want to build my own town where people live in and call a place home: Cult of the Lamb, Sims, and Animal Crossing.
                While video games can get a bad rep, its truly a hobby that unites millions of people around the world and an art form. 
                Take the company TellTale games for example. 
                Since the early 2010's they've been making story driven games where players decide how the story goes. 
                They were wildly successful and praised. The graphics weren't outstanding, the gameplay isn't other worldly but the story and emotion the games brought is what made people love them. 
                Now for my own need I'll list off some of my favorite games of all time in no order:

                Games will always be a confort to me. 
                No matter the stage in my life I may be in I know at the end of the day I can wind down with a game I love. 
                It's also something I can test myself with. Everyday I'm getting better at something. Just like making this page everyday I'm getting better at Web Development. 
                The themes of video games are something you can also apply to real life the same way you would for a movie or a TV show.

                Thankfully, I didn't gave to use much AI to help me create this page and make it functional. 
                I didn't use any AI to create any photos. 
                The prompts I used are as followed:  
            </p><br>
            <p>
                "How can I create a JS function that allows the user to switch to a different section inside the page as if it was a different page"
            </p><br>
            <p>
                "How can I embed a youtube video into my html file"
            </p><br>
            <p>
                Both prompts were used in CHATGPT and were adjusted to match the variables inside the html file.
