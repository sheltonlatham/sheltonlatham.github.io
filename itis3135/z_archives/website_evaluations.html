            <section>
                <h3><a href="https://www.craigslist.org/about/sites">Craigslist</a></h3>
                <p>The first website we'll be evaluating is Craigslist. A site well known to everyone where anyone anywhere can visit if they are looking for some help but don't have the money to pay someone to do it. Most people use the site to tell random things they are looking to get rid of.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>C: Craigslist from a design point of view accomplishes the Contrast part of C.R.A.P. With a white background all text is either a black color or a standout blue color. The text stands out and isn't hard to read.</li>
                    <li>R: Craigslist does not follow repetition. Every link takes you to a page with a new format. Even when click onto a post the format is nothing similar to previous pages.</li>
                    <li>A: Craigslist does not follow alignment. The home page where it lists all areas where craigslist is available, each section is either longer or shorter than others. When going through posts things are alligned but its not consistent across the webiste. </li>
                    <li>P: Craigslist does follow proximity for the most part. Categories or places that are related are close together but in parts of the webiste objects can be almost too close to eachother or its too small the read clearly.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3><a href="https://spotify.design/">Spotify Design</a></h3>
                <p>Spotify Design is a website for the design communtity in mind. Its used to allow creators and listeners a way to make a connection to one another. Spotify also used this website to give helpful information towards it creaters and listeners.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>C: Spotify Design follows contrast. Every page you go to changes its background to better contrast the different sections. Not only is it clear but it looks fantastic.</li>
                    <li>R: Spotify Design follows repetition. Each page has the same header and footer. With the main body being square sections with a popping image, its category, title, and a small paragraph underneath. </li>
                    <li>A: Spotify Design follows alignment. Pages are set up in either a 2 sections per row or 4 per row. No matter the size of the sections they'll line up perfectly with each other.</li>
                    <li>P: Spotify Design follows proximity. Everything thats on the Spotify Design website is similar to eachother so everything is close but not too close. When exploring the website its very easy to find exactly what you are looking for. </li>
                </ul>
